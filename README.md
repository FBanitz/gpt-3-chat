## About â„¹
This is a AI chat application created using Flutter/Dart and the davinci-003 model via the OpenAi's API. It is designed to provide an interactive and engaging experience for users. It is greately inspired by [Chat GPT](https://chat.openai.com) but, because this app uses the OpenAi's API, it is much more responsive and less prone to shortages of the OpenAi's servers, and is available for Android, Windows and Web (see [Download](#download) and [Setup](#setup)). The user interface is open source, so you can see how it works and even contribute to it ! (Note that the OpenAI API is not, see their [Terms of use](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use))

No data is collected or stored by the application. Data is stored in cache locally on the user's device and is purged when the application is closed.

I am not affiliated with OpenAI in any way and I am not in any way responsible for the data processed and potentialy stored by OpenAi or any misuse of the API by the user. This is just a fun project I made for fun.

## Download ðŸ“¥
In order to use the application, you must first download the app from the [release page](https://github.com/FBanitz/gpt-3-chat/releases). The application is available for Android, Windows and Web (if you can run a web server yourself). It is not available for iOS and MacOS, as I do not have a Mac to build the app for these platforms (btw if you have a Mac and want to build the app for these platforms, feel free to do so and send me a pull request).

## Setup ðŸ› 
Go to 'settings' and enter your API key. You can get one here: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

Note that I do not provide any API keys, so you will have to get one yourself. I know that I have leaked a key int this repo in the past, but I have since revoked it, so no free key for you this time, nice try ðŸ˜‹.

Also, the API key is not stored in the app, so you will have to enter it every time you open the app.
